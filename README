									Ajaxtab
=================================================================================================================

Description:
============
		Ajaxtab is an on-demand loader or a lazy loader which helps the developer with a bunch of javascript and
	css to structure the contents in a tabular manner and load the contents only when it is needed. This plugin also
	provides the ability to make javascript call backs with complete customization.
	
		Using ajaxtab a user can switch between the tabs or work with the rest of the page while the requested
	contents are being loaded.
	
		Ajaxtab helps the developer to arrange tabs vertically or horizontally without any additional head breaks.
	
		Ajaxtab also comes with theming capability enabling the developers to select among the available themes and
	also the ability to add themes of his own without having to change the existing themes. A theme in ajaxtab is nothing
	but a bunch of css styles with the theme name as its css class selector.


Advantages of Ajaxtab:
======================
	1. A single ajaxtab can have few tabs with contents loaded when the page is loaded and others get loaded only when
	   it is required.
	
	2. We can have more than one ajaxtabs working in a single page without having to make any changes to javascripts.
	
	3. Tabcontents once loaded are not reloaded.
	
	4. Support of javascript call backs with complete customization (Eg: onselect, ondeselect, onloading, oncomplete, etc).
	
	5. Support for themes and addition of new themes.
	
	6. We can have tabs arranged vertically or horizontally.
	
	7. No browser specific javascripts used.
	
	8. Using ajaxtab saves space on the browser as well as reduces initial loading time.


Installation
============
	1. Download the plugin from http://github.com/heurionconsulting/ajax_tab, extract and put it inside your vendor/plugin directory.
		or
	   Clone using "git clone git://github.com/heurionconsulting/ajax_tab.git" into your vendor/plugin directory


Usage
=====
	Once the installation is done, add the following code to your view (probably in layouts)

		<%= ajaxtab_includes %>

		This will include all the necessary javascript and css files that ajaxtab has come with.
	
	Note:- ajaxtab requires prototype.js library to function. Include the library before using the "ajaxtab_includes".
		
	Add the following inside views to create ajaxtabs.
	
	<%= ajaxtab(tabs=[], options={}) %>
	
	where:
		tabs => An array, where each element of the array is an hash with a minimum of following information:
					:name => Name of the tab
					
					:content => Content of the tab. When this is present :url is ignored.
						or
					:url=>Url from which content can be fetched (Use url_for() method to generate the url)
				
				It can also contain following optional information:
					:onselect => A javascript code that is executed whenever the tab is clicked
					:ondeselect => A javascript code that is executed whenever the user leaves the tab.
					
				Following options are javascripts that are executed based on the status of the ajax call made to the
				specified url. Note: these javascripts are executed not more than once, since the contents are
				loaded from the url only once.
					:loading => Executed when the ajax call is generated.
					:complete => Executed when the ajax call is completed.
					:success => Executed when the ajax call is successfull.
					:failure => Executed when the ajax call fails.
				
				Any other options specied for the tab (apart from the above listed options), will go as html attributes
				for the tab. Eg: if :style is specified, it will be used as the html style attribute for the tab.
		
		options => This is an optional argument and can contain following information:
					:defaulttab => Index of the element in tabs which is selected by default. Default value is 0.
					
					:dimension => Specifies how the tabs are to be arranged. Value can be either :vertical or :horizontal.
								  Default value of :dimension is :vertical.
								  
					:themeclass => Name of theme to be used. Ajaxtab has following themeclasses by derault
									:bluetheme_vertical, :bluetheme_horizontal, :blacktheme_vertical, :blacktheme_horizontal
									:pinktheme_vertical, :pinktheme_horizontal, :greentheme_vertical, :greentheme_horizontal
								
								   Default styles will be used if no themename is given or if css is not defined for the given themename
								   
								   New theme can also be created and can be used as themeclass. See "How to create themes?"
								   below for more information on creating themes.
								   
					:name => A unique name for the ajaxtab. This name will be used as html id attribute. This name can
							also be used to give specific styles to the ajaxtab and will override theme styles.
							
							Note:- :name should be unique to avoid conflicts. If name is not specified, ajaxtab will automatically
							assign a unique name.
					
					:indicator => This is the content that is displayed while ajax is working. By default it contains an image_tag
							for /images/ajaxtab/ajaxtab_loader.gif.
		
How to create themes?
=====================
		A theme in ajaxtab is nothing but a bunch of css styles and name of theme is used as a css class selector.
	So defining a style for your theme will begin with "."(.<themename>). Themes are defined in public/stylesheets/ajaxtab/themes.css file
	and this file is included by derfault with <%= ajaxtab_includes %>. Adding/modifying themes (styles) in this file will help you to sort out css precedence problems.
	
	Format for defining styles for your theme:
	----------------------------------------------
	
	.<themename> .ajaxtab_contents
	{
	    /* Styles for ajaxtab contents */
	}
		
	.<themename> .ajaxtab_sel_tab
	{
	    /* This style is applied for selected tab */
	}
		
	.<themename> .ajaxtab_unsel_tab
	{
	    /* This style is applied for unselected tab */
	}
	
	
	Format for defining specific styles for the ajaxtab using ajaxtab name:
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	#<name> .ajaxtab_contents
	{
	    /* Styles for ajaxtab contents */
	}
		
	#<name> .ajaxtab_sel_tab
	{
	    /* This style is applied for selected tab */
	}
		
	#<name> .ajaxtab_unsel_tab
	{
	    /* This style is applied for unselected tab */
	}
	
	
	For safety reasons make sure that changes made to this file are also updated in vendor/plugins/ajaxtab/assets/stylesheets/theme.css
		
Example
=======
	Using ajaxtab:
	--------------
		<%
			tabs = []
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 1", :content=>"Contents for tab 1"}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 2", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab2")}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 3", :content=>"Contents for tab 3"}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 4", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab4")}
		%>
		
		<%= ajaxtab(tabs) %>
	
	Using partial as content:
	-------------------------
		<%
			tabs = []
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 1", :content=>render(:partial=>'partialtab1')}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 2", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab2")}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 3", :content=>render(:partial=>'partialtab3')}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 4", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab4")}
		%>
		
		<%= ajaxtab(tabs) %>
	
	To arrange tabs horizontally:
	-----------------------------
		<%
			tabs = []
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 1", :content=>"Contents for tab 1"}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 2", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab2")}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 3", :content=>"Contents for tab 3"}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 4", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab4")}
		%>
		
		<%= ajaxtab(tabs, :dimension=>:horizontal) %>
	
	
	JavaScript callbacks:
	---------------------
		<%
			tabs = []
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 1", :content=>"Contents for tab 1", :onselect=>"alert(':onselect for tab1');", :ondeselect=>"alert(':ondeselect for tab1');"}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 2", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab2")}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 3", :content=>"Contents for tab 3"}
			tabs << {:name=>"Tab 4", :url=>url_for(:action=>"tab4"), :onloading=>"alert('loading tab4');"}
		%>
		
		<%= ajaxtab(tabs, :dimension=>:horizontal) %>
